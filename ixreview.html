<p>The <em>iPhone X</em> is the huge leap forward that Apple's handsets needed after ten years, and it's even better in 2018 thanks to a more stable iOS 11.3 update. Aside from the original iPhone in 2007, this new iPhone is having the biggest impact on Apple’s smartphone direction ever.</p>
	
<p>Apple itself is calling it the future of the smartphone, the embodiment of what it’s been trying to achieve for a decade. But while the <em>iPhone X</em> is all about premium parts and an all-new experience, it’s a huge gamble for the Cupertino brand too, as it tries to reclaim some leadership in smartphone innovation.</p>
	
<p>Losing known, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone – and charging a lot more for the privilege – seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack last year.</p>
	
<p>But the <em>iPhone X</em> is the handset we’ve been demanding from Apple for years – a world away from the increasingly-tired designs that those who just want a new iPhone have had to make do with.</p>

<p>We've had the <em>iPhone X</em> in our grasp for a more than six months now, and it's easily one of the best smartphones around.
